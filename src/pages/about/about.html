    <p>
      EVAssistant is a smart way of dealing with the problems faced by 
      electric vehicles in case of no or low power. The assistant provides 
      three economical solutions for above mentioned problem to the owner of 
      the Electric Vehicle.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First, it provides a technical solution by which one can find the 
        nearest charging or swapping station based on the factors mentioned 
        in the problem statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second, It focuses on building a platform where the owner of Electric 
        Vehicle in case of no power can contact to the people who are willing 
        to provide power from their vehicle or swap the battery to them by 
        taking reasonable amount of money (these can be small companies or 
        individuals). Also, this could be a source of livelihood for some 
        people. We are planning to set up a rating system for the people so 
        that fraud can be controlled.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third, if above mentioned facilities are not available, the person can call nearby mobile charging stations(a bike carrying battery).
